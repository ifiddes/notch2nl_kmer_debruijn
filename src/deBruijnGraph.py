class DeBruijnGraph(object):
    """
    Represents a DeBruijnGraph using networkx. Sequences are stored on each node as a
    k-1mer with edges pointing towards the next k-1mer in the original sequence.

    When initialized, a kmer size must be provided.

    To add sequences to this graph, pass Biopython SeqRecords to add_sequences().
    Once you have loaded sequences, prune the graph using prune_graph().

    prune_graph() removes all edges that fit into the rules below. This creates linear
    weakly connected components which represent continuous segments of sequence
    that represent one or more paralogs and can be used to infer copy number.

    1) every node with more than 1 outgoing edge has all outgoing edges removed
    2) every node with more than 1 incoming edge has all incoming edges removed
    3) every edge connecting two nodes with a different # of input sequences is removed
    This by definition removes all cycles as well as all strong connected components.
